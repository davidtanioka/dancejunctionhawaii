			<p>In 2006, DJH travelled to Dallas, Texas for National and International Competition. In their first competition, the Jr Company was awarded the National Championship in lyrical dance. The Sr Company walked away with numerous awards including National Championships in jazz, pom and lyrical and received the Best in Class Award. The Srs also won international titles in jazz and lyrical and were ranked #1 among the 26 teams that competed Internationally. Lyndsey won the Sr solo division. Marisa was 1st runner up in the Jr division. The company then attended Spotlight's competition for the first time and were honored with several awards. Both Lyndsey and Marisa captured the Spotlight solo titles in their divisions. In 2007, DJH attended Sharp International and Spotlight competitions. At Sharp, the team placed first in every division and earned the Sweepstakes Award. Marisa won the Sr. solo division with Lyndsey placing 2nd. The team had another strong showing at Spotlight earning several awards including 3 Judge's choice awards. Lace won the Sr. Dance Down division. That summer, the company then travelled to Tokyo, Japan for international competition. Dance Junction competed against over 90 teams and were awarded third in lyrical and won the coveted show division with their Hawaii Production number, "Rainbow Connection" which included Hula Kahiko, Hula Auwana, jazz, and lyrical forms of dance and a performance by the lovely Lehua Carvalho. Marisa won Miss Dance/Drill Team International with Lyndsey taking first runner up. In 2008, Dance Junction travelled to Texas to compete soloists at two national competitions. The three talented dancers first competed at American Dance/Drill Team USA where there were over 500 soloists. Lyndsey won the Sr solo division title for the 2nd time. The next day, at MA Dance Nationals, Lyndsey placed fourth among 150 Sr soloists. In May, the team competed at Spotlight Dance Cup. The company won a diamond for their production, "Rainbow Connection." The silver squad won diamonds in jazz, lyrical, and the open division also taking the 1st and 2nd highest scores overall. The team also won numerous judges' choice awards as well as the technique award and the Director's Choice award. Lyndsey again won the Miss Spotlight title and the technique award. Laura, Marisa, and Kellye were each category winners. In 2009, Dance Junction performed in several shows and was represented at Nationals in Texas by three soloists. Marisa placed 5th out of 76 dancers in the Sr. division while Lyndsey placed 3rd in the college division. DJH also welcomed nine new team members ages 6-9 as part of the Jr. Company. In 2011, the Jr company traveled to California for their first regional competition and placed 1st and 2nd also winning the judges choice awards. Congratulations to them! Also in 2011, Dance Junction was proud to have grown again, welcoming another team of young dancers- the "pink squad" to the company. Congratulations to Cianna (overall captain), Miss Lyndsey, and Miss Marisa who competed in Redondo Beach, CA in 2012 in the Pro-Am division and won the Platinum award and the Judges' Choice award for Precision. In 2013 the entire company traveled to California for competition and were honored with several awards and judges choice awards as well. The group of 80 travelers were also happy to spend time at Disneyland and Knott's Berry Farm! In 2013, DJH welcomed another team of young dancers, grades 2-4 on the "purple squad" and our youngest team, the "sparkle squad" for preschool- kindergarten in 2015. Last March, the entire company travelled to Tacoma, Washington for regional competition. In a successful showing, all 10 routines earned the Platinum Awards and numerous overall awards. Alia Levi competed 3 solos, also winning 3 Platinums as well as the highest overall score. Congratulations to the team and Alia! Following the competition, the team enjoyed exploring Seattle and playing in the snow. In January, Dance Junction will begin its spring session with classes for dancers ages three through eighteen.
